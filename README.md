Project Title: IoT-Based Home Automation System using Arduino and Blynk
Overview:
This project involves the development of a simulated IoT-based home automation system using the Picsimlab simulator and Blynk mobile application. The system allows control over various home devices such as lights, temperature, and water tank valves through sensor readings and mobile app commands.

Features:
Garden Lights Control: Automatically adjust garden lights based on LDR sensor readings.
Temperature Control: Monitor and control home temperature using a heating resistor, LM35 sensor, and cooler. Manage these devices via the Blynk app.
Water Tank Management: Monitor water levels and control inlet/outlet valves through serial communication and Blynk app inputs.
User Interface: Blynk app serves as the control panel, with widgets to manage devices and display real-time data.
Technology Stack:
Hardware: Arduino, Picsimlab Simulator
Software: Blynk IoT Application, CLCD for data display
Programming Language: C/C++
Project Structure:
Functional Requirements: Detailed specifications for each component like garden lights, temperature control, and water tank management.
User Interfaces: Widgets and virtual terminals in the Blynk app for device control and notifications.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation including requirement analysis, design, and use-case scenarios.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates an effective simulation of a smart home system, enabling users to control and monitor home devices remotely using the Blynk IoT application.
